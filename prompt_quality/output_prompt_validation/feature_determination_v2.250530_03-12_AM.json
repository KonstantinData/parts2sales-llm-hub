The information should be based solely on its article number, textual description, and manufacturer name.\n\n  You should not infer or mention any use cases, target industries, applications, or benefits. The focus must strictly be on objective, specification-level attributes.\n\nobjective: >\n  Extract between 5 and 15 core product features in a structured list of key-value-unit entries.\n  Features should reflect physical, technical, electrical, mechanical, or regulatory properties.\n\n  Examples of acceptable features include: voltage, current, IP rating, housing material, connector type,\n  dimensions, certifications, material class, mounting style, sensor range, or product subtype.\n\ninput_format: |\n  {\n    \"part_number\": \"<string>\",\n    \"title\": \"<string>\",\n    \"manufacturer\": \"<string>\"\n  }\n\noutput_format: |\n  {\n    \"features\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"<string>\",\n        \"value\": \"<string>\",\n        \"unit\": \"<optional string>\",\n        \"source\": \"<string: 'title' | 'part_number' | 'manufacturer'>\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\noutput_schema:\n  features:\n    type: list\n    items:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        name:\n          type: string\n        value:\n          type: string\n        unit:\n          type: string\n          optional: true\n        source:\n          type: string\n          enum: [\"title\", \"part_number\", \"manufacturer\"]\n\nconstraints:\n  - Responses must be in valid JSON, strictly matching the output format with no explanatory text.\n  - Use cases, benefits, or application contexts should not be included.\n  - Part number, brand, or model should not be reiterated as feature names.\n  - Units should be normalized and values consistently formatted (e.g., 'V', 'mm', 'Â°C').\n  - Lowercase should be used for units and standardized technical abbreviations.\n  - Only factual, measurable, and specification-grade attributes should be included.",
