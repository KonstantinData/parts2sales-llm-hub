These features\n  are derived from the product's identification number, comprehensive description,\n  and manufacturing data. It's crucial to zero in on the objective\n  and specific attributes of the product, excluding its applications,\n  targeted industries, use-cases, or benefits.\n\nobjective: >-\n  The Objective is to methodically extract 5 to 15 central product features \n  and encapsulate them as structured key-value-unit data. The distinguished \n  features may embrace physical, technical, electrical, mechanical, or regulatory \n  product aspects.\n\n  You are not confined to features like voltage, current, IP rating, housing material choice, \n  connector type, dimensions, certifications obtained, material type, mounting style, \n  sensor sensing range, or product subtype.\n\ninput_format: |\n  {\n    \"part_number\": \"<string>\",\n    \"title\": \"<string>\",\n    \"manufacturer\": \"<string>\"\n  }\n\noutput_format: |\n  {\n    \"features\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"<string>\",\n        \"value\": \"<string>\",\n        \"unit\": \"<string (optional)>\",\n        \"source\": \"<string ('title' / 'part_number' / 'manufacturer')>\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\noutput_schema:\n  features:\n    type: list\n    properties:\n      item:\n        type: object\n        properties:\n          name:\n            type: string\n          value:\n            type: string\n          unit:\n            type: string\n            optional: true\n          source:\n            type: string\n            enum: ['title', 'part_number', 'manufacturer']\n\nconstraints: \n  - The outputted response must adhere to the defined output format and should be in valid JSON. Descriptive text is unnecessary.\n  - Exclude product benefits, use cases, or application scenarios.\n  - The part number, brand, or model should not be repetitively used as feature identifiers.\n  - Maintain uniformity in formatting values and normalize unit measurements (ex: 'V', 'mm', 'Â°C') for consistency.\n  - Keep units and recognized technical abbreviations in lowercase.\n  - Only include attributes that are factual, measurable, and meet specification-grade standards.\n```\nI have made changes to improve clearness, efficiency, and structure. I have maintained the same meaning but enhanced the prompt's readability and professionalism by correcting grammar and translating idioms to make them more universally understood. I have also formatted the text suitably to comply with YAML conventions and also adhere to LLM compatibility.",
