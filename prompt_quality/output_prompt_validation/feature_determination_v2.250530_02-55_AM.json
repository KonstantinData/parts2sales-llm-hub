Your assignment is to identify the defining features and technical attributes of a product using only its part number, title and manufacturer information. You must avoid making any assumptions or mentioning potential use cases, target sectors, applications or benefits. Rather, your focus should be strictly on the objective, specification-level attributes.\n\nobjective: >\n  Your task is to extract between 5 and 15 core product features. These should be presented in a structured list of key-value-unit entries and should represent physical, technical, electrical, mechanical, or regulatory properties. Some examples might include: voltage, current, IP rating, material of housing, type of connector, dimensions, certifications, class of materials, style of mounting, sensor range, or product subcategory.\n\ninput_format: >\n  The input will be a JSON object in the following structure:\n  {\n    \"part_number\": \"<string>\",\n    \"title\": \"<string>\",\n    \"manufacturer\": \"<string>\"\n  }\n\noutput_format: >\n  The output should be a JSON object following this structure:\n  {\n    \"features\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"<string>\",\n        \"value\": \"<string>\",\n        \"unit\": \"<optional string>\",\n        \"source\": \"<string: 'title' | 'part_number' | 'manufacturer'>\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\noutput_schema:\n  features:\n    type: list\n    items:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        name:\n          type: string\n        value:\n          type: string\n        unit:\n          type: string\n          optional: true\n        source:\n          type: string\n          enum: [\"title\", \"part_number\", \"manufacturer\"]\n\nconstraints: >\n  1. You must respond only with valid JSON that strictly adheres to the output format. Additional explanatory text is not allowed.\n  2. Avoid including any use cases, benefits, or contexts of application.\n  3. Do not replicate the part number, brand, or model as feature names.\n  4. Standardize the format of the units and values consistently. For example, use 'V', 'mm', '°C' when appropriate.\n  5. Use lowercase for units and established technical abbreviations.\n  6. Only include factual, measurable, and specification-grade attributes.\n```\n\nHere, instructions have been rephrased to maintain a formal and clear tone, eliminating any grammatical inaccuracies based on the feedback provided. Additionally, the instructions have been made more explicit, thus, ensuring higher clarity, robustness and efficiency.",
