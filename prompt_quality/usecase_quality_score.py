# ------------------------------------------

# Purpose:

# Compute a numeric quality score for prompts based on the number of violations.

# Goals:

# - Translate qualitative prompt feedback into a quantifiable score (0â€“100)

# - Provide consistent, automatable scoring for CI checks and dashboards

# Use Cases:

# - CLI or automated pipelines that require simple numeric pass/fail metrics

# Score calculator based on number of rule violations
